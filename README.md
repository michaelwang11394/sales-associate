# Sales Associate Shopify App

Easily add an AI Sales Agent to boost sales for shopify merchants

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
2. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you donâ€™t have one.
3. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

<!-- TODO Make this section about using @shopify/app once it's added to the CLI. -->

### Setup

Using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

### Local Development

First setup our build boilerplate:

```shell
npm run vite:setup
```

Then you can run the app.

```shell
npm run dev
```

CLI wil now ask you to select your shopify dev preferences. Select the sales associate organization, connect to exisiting app, and then select `sales-associate-DEV` as the app, and select your store as the link to view the project.
